## 🧙 League Spell Tracker

This project began as a fun experiment to recreate the spell cooldown overlay feature that Riot removed after disabling tools like Blitz and Porofessor.

Riot claimed those overlays gave players an **unfair advantage**. Ironically, as this little project shows, anyone can rebuild the same functionality in about 10 minutes with GPT - the only difference now is that you'll be **the only one** with access to that information.
So in removing Blitz and Porofessor, Riot may have actually made things more exclusive, not less.

## ⚙️ How to Use

### Build local assets
Run League Assets builder.py to cache champion, spell, and ultimate icons locally.

You only need to do this when new champions or visual updates are added.

### Start the overlay
Launch `spell.py to` open the overlay.

### Sync with your current match
Once you're in a game, click the 🔃 Sync icon.

The tool will fetch live match data and load the enemy team's champions, spells, and ultimates automatically.

### Adjust settings

⚙️ opens sliders for scale and transparency.

🔒 / 🔓 toggles overlay lock, preventing accidental movement.

Left-click a spell to start its cooldown timer.

Right-click resets the spell back to "up".

Shift + Click allows manual timer input.

### 🧩 The future of this app
Well, as stated initially, it all started as a fun / meme project to prove a point. Since it's well received by the community I might continue improving and developing the app with the following features:

- [ ] Save user settings (scale, transparency, position)
- [ ] Auto-detect match start and sync automatically
- [ ] Show overlay only when League is focused/fullscreen
- [ ] Polish the UI / visual design
- [ ] Release as a runnable .exe or .vbs for easier use
